# RobotArm
This is a design and build of a robotic arm\
\
Arm segements, gripper and base were 3D printed\
\
GCode for 3d prints: [HERE](https://github.com/NiMez/RobotArm/tree/main/GCode).\
Model: [HERE](https://github.com/NiMez/RobotArm/tree/main/Model).\
\
Two different controls have been uploaded:
- Inverse Kinematic Loop. A loop picking up and dropping a ball in straight lines relative to the gripper.
- Servo control from potentiometer.
